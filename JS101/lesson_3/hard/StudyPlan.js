// Specific Topics of Interest
In general, you should be familiar with JavaScript syntax and operators. 
You should also be able to clearly explain, talk about, or demonstrate the following topics:

(done) naming conventions: legal vs. idiomatic, illegal vs. non-idiomatic
(done) primitive values vs. objects
(ongoing) type coercions: explicit and implicit
(done)numbers, including NaN and Infinity
(done) strings
(ongoing) template literals
boolean vs. truthiness
undefined and null
array and object syntax
array properties and methods: array.length, array.push, array.pop, array.reverse
object methods: Object.keys
operators
numeric operators: +, -, *, /, %
string operators: +
conditional operators: ===, !==, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, ternary
loose and strict equality
logical operators and short-circuit evaluation: !, &&, ||
the typeof operator
operator precedence
explicit and implicit coercions with strings and numbers
mutability, immutability, and const
variables
identifier: variable names, constant names, function names, property names
variable and constant declarations
initialization, assignment, and reassignment
scope
variables as pointers
variable shadowing
conditionals and loops
console.log
readline-sync and the question method
require
functions
functions vs. methods
declarations, expressions, arrow functions
definition and invocation
default parameters
return values
parameters vs. arguments
function, block, local, and global scope
nested functions
function composition
output vs. return values, side effects
pass-by-reference and pass-by-value
the call stack
expressions and statements
exceptions: throwing and catching
common Math methods: Math.floor, Math.random, Math.pow
discuss a function's use and purpose (a "user-level" description) instead of its implementation
